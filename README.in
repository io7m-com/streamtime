## streamtime

The `streamtime` package provides a simple extension to Java I/O streams that
can track transfer rates and provide statistics.

## Features

* Input and output stream implementations that track and regularly broadcast
  transfer statistics.
* High coverage test suite.
* [OSGi-ready](https://www.osgi.org/).
* [JPMS-ready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System).
* ISC license.

## Usage

Create a `STTimedInputStream` from an existing `InputStream`, and provide it
with a `Consumer<STTransferStatistics>` function that receives transfer updates:

```
InputStream is;
Consumer<STTransferStatistics> f;

try (var input = new STTimedInputStream(f, is)) {
  input.transferTo(...);
}
```

The `f` function will be called at a rate of roughly once per second, with
a new value of type `STTransferStatistics` describing the expected number of
octets, the current number of octets, and the current number of octets received
per second.

The `STTimedOutputStream` class works similarly, but for `OutputStream` values.
